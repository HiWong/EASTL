## FAQ: ##

##### Why is this repo here?

A few years ago, EA released the source code to their EASTL library in the form of a zip download. Since people really
like Github, I took that source, reorganized it a little, and pushed it onto Github, where it received lots of love and stars.

##### But now it's obsolete?

Well, as of Feburary 2016, EASTL created their own repo located at https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL . That repo is
more up-to-date than what we have here, and it's officially maintained. This repo is no longer maintained.

##### What about the community contributions on this repo?

We did receive some decent contributions in this repo, however this repo is lacking any sort of leader / maintainer to
review those contributions. (I asked around at one point and there weren't any takers!). I encourage all contributers to submit
their work towards the electronicarts/EASTL repo instead, or create a new fork based off of electronicarts/EASTL.
